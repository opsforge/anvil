Some of the functionality ANViL includes (but is by no means limited to):

- Testing or compiling code on your development environment with no consequences (throw it out by re-creating the container)
- Accessing the host's Docker Engine from the browser on the Remote Shell and create new containers or kill existing ones
- Install any Linux package on the ANViL Shell and use them
- Compile and use your own Docker image for Remote Shell adding extra binaries or removing ones you don't need
- Using plugins like Splunk or ELK, where no configuration is required and all of them are fully functional right after startup
- RDP to other machines using Guacamole from your browser
- Ship logs from the ANViL Shell to ELK or Splunk for review or audit. This includes your shell output if you need it. No more CTRL+R or history grepping needed.
- Have any amount shells open in individual browser windows or use screen and tmux to keep them in one.

Remember, that all ANViL components are open-source, including the Docker images used, so if you want to change anything or add your own, you have
all that you need at your disposal.
